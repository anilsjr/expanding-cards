#Summary
Expanding Cards provides a visually appealing way to present content in a card layout. Each card expands when clicked, showcasing the content in an engaging manner.

#Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

#How It Works
 The application consists of a set of cards (panels) displayed in a container. When a panel is clicked, it expands to show more content while the other panels contract. This is achieved using CSS transitions and JavaScript event listeners.

1. HTML: Structures the layout with a container holding multiple panels.
2. CSS: Styles the panels and container, including transitions for the expanding effect.
3. JavaScript: Adds event listeners to the panels to handle the click events and toggle the active state.

To get started with the project, simply clone the repository and open index.html in your browser.
